# Angular-Titanic-Dashboard-

## ðŸš€ Setup and Running the Project

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

### **1. Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.x or 20.x is recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

It is also highly recommended to install the **Angular CLI** globally if you haven't already.
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### **2. Extract and Prepare the Project**

First, **extract the `.zip` file** containing the project source code into a directory of your choice.

Once extracted, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate into the project's root folder. This is the folder that contains the `package.json` file.
```bash
# Example:
cd path/to/your/extracted/titanic-dashboard
```

### **3. Install Dependencies**

This project uses npm for package management. Run the following command in the project's root directory to install all the required dependencies from the `package.json` file.
```bash
npm install
```
This might take a few moments to complete.

### **4. Run the Development Server**

Once all dependencies are installed, you can start the application with the Angular CLI's `serve` command.
```bash
ng serve
```

The application will be available at **`http://localhost:4200/`**.
